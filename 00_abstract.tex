\chapter{Abstract}

Over the past years, websites have advanced from merely displaying content to representing interfaces to dynamic server-side applications of various scales; other environments like mobile platforms tend to use the same HTTP interfaces as well. To limit the cost of server hardware, various software-based approaches aim to maximise the number of simultaneous operations by shifting from the classic per-request threading model to more sophisticated concurrency patterns. This thesis presents and compares a number of different approaches to server-side concurrency implementations from the view of a developer. Typical use-cases for server-side information flow are contrived and evaluated regarding asynchronous processing. Patterns are then reviewed based on their performance in scalable high-throughput networking applications by the example of live applications as well as experimental settings.
