abstract = {Scala has established itself as a viable alternative to Java, and powerful new tools make it easier than ever to get started. Play 2 is an open source web framework for building browser-based applications in Scala. It takes advantage of Scala's strong type system to give high-performance, bug-free code. Because it's event-based and non-blocking, it's a great choice for near real time applications. And it makes use of the web's stateless nature to offer excellent scalability and flexibility. Play for Scala shows how to build Scala-based web applications using the Play 2 framework. It starts by introducing Play! through a comprehensive overview example. Then, it looks at each facet of a typical Play application, both by exploring simple code snippets and by adding to a larger running example.},

@book{Henderson2006,
abstract = {SUMMARY: Slow websites infuriate users. Lots of people can visit your web site or use your web application - but you have to be prepared for those visitors, or they won't come back. Your sites need to be built to withstand the problems success creates.Building Scalable Web Sites looks at a variety of techniques for creating sites that can keep users cheerful, even when there are thousands or millions of them. Flickr.com developer, Cal Henderson, explains how to build sites so that large numbers of visitors can enjoy them. Henderson examines techniques that go beyond sheer speed, exploring how to coordinate developers, support international users, and integrate with other services from email to SOAP to RSS to the APIs exposed by many Ajax-based web applications.This book uncovers the secrets that you need to know for back-end scaling, architecture, and failover so your web sites can handle countless requests. You'll learn how to take the "poor man's web technologies", like Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, or other scripting languages, and scale them to compete with established "store bought" enterprise web technologies. Toward the end of the book, you'll discover techniques for keeping web applications running with event monitoring and long-term statistical tracking for capacity planning.If you're about to build your first dynamic web site, then Building Scalable Web Sites isn't for you. But if you're an advanced developer who's ready to realize the cost and performance benefits of a comprehensive approach to scalable applications, then let your fingers do the walking through this convenient guide.},

From the very beginning, you'll be writing working code in order to see best practices and concepts in action. As the book progresses, the concepts and code will become more sophisticated. Beginning with an overview of the web service model in general and Web API in particular, you'll progress quickly to a detailed exploration of the request binding and response formatting that lie at the heart of Web API. You'll investigate various scenarios and see how they can be manipulated to achieve the results you need. Later in the book more sophisticated themes will be introduced that will set your applications apart from the crowd. Youâ€™ll learn how you can validate the request messages on arrival, how you can create loosely coupled controllers, extend the pipeline processing to compartmentalize your code for security and unit testing before being put onto a live hosting server.},
